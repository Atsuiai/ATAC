This file contains all the variables needed for ATAC.
The first word of a line must be the variable name (cannot rename), followed by a single space, followed by the value.
Comments can be placed anywhere, so long as the first word in the line is not a variable name.

***GENERAL EXECUTION HANDLING VARIABLES***

masterBatchName Testing
 
numberOfRuns 200000000
relaxationSteps 5
acceptAnyMutation 0
haveNonInteracting 0
relaxOnFailure 0
relaxationMethod 1
isRestart 0

***MUTATION VARIABLES***

mutationGo 1   Value of 0 just relaxes the structure, 1 activates no-mass-flux mutation.

ratioRotate 0.999
ratioDimerDisplacement 0.0
ratioSp2ToSp3 0.001

noFluxRatioShift 1   Value of 0 keeps ratios constant throughout entire run. Ratio of 1 will linearly decrease the sp2 to sp3 ratio, and raise the rotation ratio by the same amount, to the specified final values, when a run is accepted.

ratioShiftRate 0.00001
ratioRotateFinal 1
ratioSp2ToSp3Final 0

rotationsPerRun 1   If a rotation mutaion is taken, this int indicates how many rotations are taken before checking for energy. For accelerating the simulation.

***TEMPERATURE VARIABLES***

tempS 1250    starting temperature, in kelvin.
tempF 500    finishing/asymptotic temperature, in kelvin.
coolMethod 0    cooling method: 0 is none (starting temp does not change), 1 is linear, 2 is Newtonian.
coolR 2.5    cooling rate constant in K/run for linear and K for Newtonian.

***PERIODICITY VARIABLES***

periodicityNum 0    Value is the number of dimentions the system is perodic in: 0 for none, 1 for along X, 2 for along X, Y. (3 not yet implimented.)

periodicOnlyOnNonInteracting 0   Inconsequential if periodicityNum == 0.
isStaticPeriod 0   0 for lattice parameter based on given system, 1 for a set given value.
xPeriodFactor 1.228024   Handy value to remember: for graphene as VMD makes it, should be 1.228024 (armchair).
yPeriodFactor 1.42   Handy value to remember: for graphene as VMD makes it, should be 1.418 (C-C bond length).
      These period factors are context dependent. With a static period, these factors will be the lattice parameters. 
      Without a static period, these factors will be added to the difference of atomic position axis extremes 
      for the lattice parameters.
zPeriodFactor 1000
LVec11 0
LVec12 0
LVec13 0
LVec21 0
LVec22 0
LVec23 0
LVec31 0
LVec32 0
LVec33 0
periodicStretching 0   This variable determines how the system's periodicity changes over time. 0 is no change, 1 is change along the x, 2 is change along x and y.
periodicStretchRate 1   This rate constant will increase the periodicity of the system by an angstrom amount, after a successful run.

***NAMD FORCE VARIABLES***

forceNum 0   Value of 0 has no force, 1 is an x-aligned tube with end-walls. force in kcal/mol*A

minWallPosModifier 0 This modifier is added to the position of the minimum-most atom position, to determine the wall position.
maxWallPosModifier 0 This modifier is added to the position of the maximum-most atom position, to determine the wall position.
wallForce 1.5
tubeRadius 8
tubeForceBase 7
tubeForceExponent 8

***BEAM VARIABLES***

haveBeam 0 
beamType 1 
beamTemperature 2500
beamRadius 10
beamAxis 3 
beamAxisIntercept1 0
beamAxisIntercept2 0
beamRadiusGrowthRate 0

***CHIRALITY VARIABLES (x algned nanotubes only)***

findChiralAngles 0   These occur on the final run, does not depend on other variables.
findChiralIndexesBasedOnAngles 0
findChiralIndexesBasedOnDiameter 0
minChiralIndex 1   minChiralIndex cannot be 0, 0 indexes will be automatically accounted for
maxChiralIndex 12
useAveragedVectors 0
vecRoundingErrorCutOff 0.2   in angstroms, only important if useAveragedVectors is 1
findChiralSpread 0  We collect a group of chiral angles that a ring can possibly be.
maxChiralAngleDifference 0.3  this is how close the theoretical angle should be to the experimental values, in degrees. findChiralSpread must be 1
findRingSizes 0  This occurs on all runs
generateRingHistogramImages 0   This occurs on all runs. findRingSizes must be true.
ringSizeMin 3
ringSizeMax 9

***ELECTRODE VARIABLES***

numberOfElectrodes 4

xpElecWallMod -3.9 //positive x electrode wall modifier (how they are selected). should be negative
xnElecWallMod 3.9 // should be positive
ypElecWallMod -3.9 // should be negative
ynElecWallMod 3.9 // should be positive

***SP2/SP3 TRANSITION VARIABLES***

sp2tosp3Tolerance 4.0
spDenialPathSize 6   must be 2 or less for reverse reaction...
reversableSpRunNum -1   Number of GLOBAL runs (not successful runs) before we change spDenialPathSize to 2. A value of -1 will always keep the path size as 4.
superfluousSp3Sp2 0
